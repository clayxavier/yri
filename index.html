		<p>I am an aspiring musician from the Bay Area. I study jazz at the California Jazz Conservatory in Berkeley, CA. I am very passionate about blending together multiple genres into one. I love Jazz, Hip Hop, RnB, Soul, Funk, Brazillian Music, you name it! I believe that music is a powerful way to express yourself and should be used as a power of good. We as musicians and entertainers need to use our influence to change the hearts and minds of our listeners for the better.</p>
